description: Setting up different controller types for use in the Cemu emulator.

In this section we will be configuring controller inputs for Cemu, and setting up motion controls.

This can vary between controllers. Nintendo Switch, Dualshock 4 and DualSense controllers all have support for motion controls.

Other controllers, such as Xbox controllers, do not support motion controls and will need to use an alternative method.

Please select your controller type below:
