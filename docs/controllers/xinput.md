## Instructions

::: tip
Motion controls are not available for Xbox controllers, making some features in games, such as shrine puzzles in Breath of the Wild, hard to use.
:::

1. Connect your Xbox controller to Windows
1. Open the Cemu application
1. On the top bar, go to `Settings` -> `Input settings`
1. Change `Emulated controller` to `Wii U Gamepad`
1. Change `Controller API` to `XInput`
1. Change `Controller` to `Controller X`
    - If you can not see any controller available, switch `Controller API` to `DirectInput`
1. Proceed to map all your controller button inputs
1. At the top, enter in a controller profile name, e.g. `Xbox Controller`
1. Click `Save`
