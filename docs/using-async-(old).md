title: Using Async
description: Enabling asynchronous shader compilation for a smoother gameplay experience.
---

Asynchronous shader compilation is a feature that, with the Vulkan rendering API, will enable Cemu to compile shaders and pipelines in the background.

This means that, rather than halting the game to wait for the shader or pipeline to compile, the shader or pipeline is skipped while Cemu waits for it to compile.

It is a popular feature, as it reduces stuttering on first playthrough. However, as they are compiled in the background, they will not appear until they are called again, causing temporary graphical issues.

::: warning
This feature is still experimental and may cause other graphical issues and instabilities.

To continue, we need to know what GPU your system is using. If you do not know what type of graphics processor you have, open the Settings app on Windows 10. Then navigate to `System` -> `Display` -> `Advanced display settings`.

Under your display name, it should say `Display #: Connected to [GPU]`. This should start with Intel, AMD or NVIDIA. That will tell you what brand of GPU you have.

Before enabling Async, we need to first download new drivers that support Vulkan 1.2's features. This is already included with the latest AMD and NVIDIA GPU drivers.

For Intel iGPUs, a beta driver may be required to be installed. You must have a 6th gen iGPU or later to use Async.

::: warning
Be aware that beta drivers can cause issues. If you are experiencing issues on a beta driver, please revert to the latest stable driver.

## Downloads

- The latest available Vulkan 1.2-supported driver
    - [Latest NVIDIA drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)
    - [Latest AMD drivers](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
    - [Intel iGPU drivers - 6th gen or newer](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)

Async on Intel may or may not be fully supported by the driver and may result in more problems on Cemu than not using Async. Please make sure you install a proper driver for your Intel GPU and OS, especially if you are using a laptop with dual graphics.

## Instructions

1. Download and install the relevant driver
1. Restart your PC
1. Open the Cemu emulator
1. On the top bar, click `Options` -> `General settings`
1. Navigate to the `Graphics` tab
1. Change `Graphics API` to `Vulkan`
1. Change `Graphics Device` to your primary GPU
1. Exit the settings and return to the Cemu games list
1. On the top bar, click `Debug` -> `Experimental`
1. Enable `Async compile (Vulkan)`

Cemu should now start compiling shaders and pipelines asynchronously. If you have downloaded new drivers or updated Cemu, you will have to recompile all pipelines while playing again.
